<p>Business attire has changed significantly over the years, especially in the last 20 years. Too many people have forgotten why proper business attire is important.Some companies prefer to allow and even encourage employees to dress freely or casually for comfort. This tends to work well in more creative work environments.<br>

However, other companies will typically encourage and/or require a more defined and professional dress code to maintain a professional image of themselves and the business, where employees routinely interact on a daily basis with prospects, clients and business partners.<br>

Conflicts arise when employees prefer to dress comfortably or in the most recent styles rather than realize the importance for them to present themselves in a more professional or conservative manner.<br>
The major reason why dressing in proper business attire is important for every business professional is because it presents a visual image and sends a message that the employees are professional.<br>
Another reason why dressing in proper business attire is important in the business world is because you never know when you will be required to meet with someone from outside your company. Your image to this outsider will be the image remembered of your company. In business dealings this image and message needs to be professional. In reality, that image could indirectly mean the difference between securing a new deal, contract or sale and losing the opportunity to make that deal.</p>
