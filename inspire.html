                <p>As CEO of SpaceX, CEO of Tesla, and co-founder of OpenAI, Musk seems to be everywhere all at once, pushing all kinds of incredible new technologies. He's said he won't be happy until we've escaped Earth and colonized Mars .

On Monday, Tesla announced that it's buying another company founded by Musk, solar-panel manufacturer SolarCity, at an enterprise value of $2.6 billion.

Between space rockets, electric cars, solar batteries, research into killer robots, and the billions he's made along the way, Musk is basically a real life Tony Stark - which is why they used him as reference for the "Iron Man."</p>
